Beyond the Clouds:
============
A mod inspired by the original Aether mod, for Minecraft 1.21.3 Built on Neoforge.

Vision:
============
We are planning to have 3 layers of dimensions above the overworld, each full of a ton of content; The cloud realm, brightest of them all (as in, peacefulness), with a few floating islands and ton of clouds; The Skyrealm, with a colder atmosphere, having more floating islands and wilderness; And The Over-Void, the most violent of these 3, here you wont find the pretty clouds you got used to, only your worst nightmares.
